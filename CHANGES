- view permission on a RSS box is set to anonymous users when creating the box:
  users having permissions in subfolders do not have the right to view boxes
  set in the .cps_boxes file higher in the hierarchy, whereas they have the right
  to view boxes set in the .cps_boxes_root file (discussed with Florent).
